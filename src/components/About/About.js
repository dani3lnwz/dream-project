            <h2 className='text-2xl font-extrabold font-serif text-gray-500 mt-5'>The guitar is a polyphonic instrument. This means that it is capable of playing more than one tone at a time, which means that it can be used to play harmonies. The only other popular instrument that excels at this is the piano. And of the two, the guitar is much easier to transport—and usually much cheaper to buy.
